## Code format

We use Clang-Format with the rules defined in the file `.clang-format`.

In the VS Code, open the user's settings and enable the option `editor.formatOnSave`. You can enable this option only for the CHESTER workspace.

## Commit style

- The commit message follows the format `domain: change` (e.g. `applications: tester: Add GPIO commands`).
- The commit message is always in imperative format (starts with a verb).
- Commit is signed with GPG and contains the `Signed-off-by: ...` sentence at the end.
- Author has properly set name, surname and email address
